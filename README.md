## Checkers

The idea is to meassure and compare my progress respect other people 
that are doing the same.

The first problem I want to solve is to have a "technology tree" 
with a lot of programming languages and differents libraries and 
topics related to them. Then I want to check which of these things 
I've already know, and what other things I need to learn. 

I thing I be able to create a more general project that allow to 
anyone to create a "checklist tree" of anything that she want.
